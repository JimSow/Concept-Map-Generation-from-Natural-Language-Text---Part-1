A miser sold all that <The Miser> had and bought a lump of gold , which <The Miser> buried in <a hole in the ground> by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily .
One of <The Miser> workmen observed <The Miser> frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch <The Miser> movements .
He soon discovered <the secret of the hidden treasure> , and digging down , came to <a lump of gold> , and stole <the secret of the hidden treasure> .
The Miser , on <The Miser> next visit , found <a hole in the ground> empty and began to tear <The Miser> hair and to make loud lamentations .
A neighbor , seeing <A neighbor> overcome with grief and learning <the cause> , said , `` Pray do not grieve so ; but go and take a stone , and place <the cause> in <a hole in the ground> , and fancy that <the gold> is still lying there .
It will do <you> quite the same service ; for when <the gold> was there , <you> had <the cause> not , as <you> did not make the slightest use of <the cause> . ''
